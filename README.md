### Bar Coupon Summary:
Drivers under 30, not widowed, who go to bars more than once a month, and travel with
friends or a partner, are significantly more likely to accept Bar coupons—about 72% vs./n 56.6% for others.

This suggests that Bar coupons appeal to younger drivers who regularly 
go out socially with friends or a partner.
